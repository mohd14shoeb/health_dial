# Flutter Health Dial

A new Flutter project consisting of a health dial Flutter App that is meant to feed a 2.1 inch round display installed on a "smart" health jacket. This is just the beginning of building the full UI for this prototype. Still in progress, so use at your own discretion. Thank you all!
